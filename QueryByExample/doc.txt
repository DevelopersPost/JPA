Query by Example (QBE)
======================
- It is a querying technique that does not require you to write classical queries to include entities and properties.
- It allows dynamic query creation and consists of three pieces: a probe, an ExampleMatcher, and an Example.
- The probe is a domain object with already-set properties. The ExampleMatcher provides the rules for matching particular properties.
- An Example puts the probe and the ExampleMatcher together and generates the query. Multiple Examples may reuse a single ExampleMatcher.

QBE has a couple of limitations:
===============================
It only supports starting/ending/containing regex matching for String properties, and exact matching for other types.
It does not support nested or grouped property constraints, such as username = ?0 or (username = ?1 and email = ?2).



CREATE TABLE user (
    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    city VARCHAR(255)
);



INSERT INTO user (name, email, city) VALUES
('Bob', 'bob@example.com', 'Los Angeles'),
('Charlie', 'charlie@example.com', 'New York'),
('Alice', 'alice2@example.com', 'Boston');
